# Quansight.github.io

Employees from a across the 🌐 at Quansight and Quansight Labs show up each day to work as a community in open source. The site is a portal into our impacts in open source, and calls to action for others to participate in our open source communities.

The Quansight.github.io repository is:
* a `quansight` module with tools we want to share that help our lives.
* a centralized portal into Quansight and Quansight Labs.
    * a publishing system for employees to share literate programs revelent to their open source lifestyle's.
* continuous integrations and bots that smoothe publishing documentation for authors and editors.

## Who runs this repository?

At Quansight we understand communication is important, and to improve our communication skills we run a multicultural writers workshop. 

For us, software is a form of self expression. This managed by the editors (ie instructors) of the Quansight #writers-workshop. During their time as instructors, they set the tone and style for our the Quansight Labs portal.
