### Our Story

Quansight was started by Travis Oliphant (NumPy, SciPy, Numba, Conda,
XND, NumFOCUS, PyData). Travis is a well-known PyData community leader
and founder of Continuum Analytics. Before Quansight, he and other
founders helped Continuum evolve into Anaconda Inc. By creating
successful enterprise software for companies utilizing open source,
our team discovered business models that bridged open source communities
with innovative companies and projects.

Quansight was spun from Anaconda in order to facilitate broad community-led
innovation in Machine-Learning and Data Science. We help our clients gain
actionable, quantitative insights from their data; we build and connect open
source communities with companies while developing talent, building
technology, and discovering new products/services and sustaining open source
communities. We are Quansight.
